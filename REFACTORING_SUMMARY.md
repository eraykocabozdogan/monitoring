# DataChart Component Refactoring Summary

## What Was Refactored

The DataChart component has been completely refactored to improve code organization, performance, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Extracted Custom Hooks** (Global scope - reusable across project)
- `useChartTimestamp` - Handles timestamp calculations and stability logic
- `useTooltipFormatter` - Manages tooltip generation and formatting
- `useProcessedSeriesData` - Processes log events into chart series data
- `useDebouncedClickHandler` - Handles chart click events with debouncing
- `useChartPinLogic` - Manages pin creation and data validation

### 2. **Created Utility Functions** (Global scope)
- `chartUtils.ts` - Chart data aggregation, color themes, and grid calculations
- `chartSeriesUtils.ts` - ECharts series configuration generation

### 3. **Extracted Sub-components** (Component-specific scope)
- `ChartControls` - Chart mode buttons and control panel
- `ChartSidebar` - Pin and interval display sidebar

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- Selective state subscription from `useAppStore` - only accessing needed slices
- Optimized `useMemo` dependencies to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Memoized the main component with `React.memo`
- Debounced chart interactions to prevent multiple rapid events

### 5. **Code Quality Improvements**
- Removed all `any` types - using proper TypeScript interfaces
- Extracted repeated logic into reusable functions
- Used modern JavaScript syntax (optional chaining, nullish coalescing)
- Self-documenting variable and function names
- Proper dependency arrays for all hooks

### 6. **Code Organization**
- 875-line monolithic component reduced to manageable, focused modules
- Clear separation of concerns between UI, logic, and data processing
- Reusable hooks and utilities that can be used by other components

```

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused modules are easier to understand and modify
2. **Reusability**: Extracted hooks and utilities can be used by other components
3. **Performance**: Optimized re-rendering and better memory usage
4. **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
5. **Testing**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
6. **Code Quality**: Modern, clean, and readable code following React best practices

## Functionality Preserved

All original functionality has been preserved:
- Chart rendering and interactions
- Pin and interval creation/management
- Tooltip display and formatting
- Data zoom and legend controls
- Chart mode switching
- Manual click handling for pin/interval modes
- All chart series (power, wind, faults, etc.)

The refactoring improves the codebase while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.
